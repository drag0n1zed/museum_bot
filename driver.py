"""
Hardware driver module for Museum Bot.

This module provides interface functions for hardware control.
The implementation can be adapted for different hardware platforms:
- DC motors via I2C (DFRobot motor controller)
- Ultrasonic sensors via GPIO pins
- Audio playback system

To use with different hardware, replace the stub implementations
with appropriate code for your specific platform.
